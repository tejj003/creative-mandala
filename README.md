## üé® Design Philosophy

The Mandala Maker embraces the meditative and spiritual nature of mandala creation while providing modern digital tools. The dark theme with purple accents creates a calming environment, while the monospace font gives it a technical, code-like aesthetic.

- **Accent**: Pink gradients (#fd79a8, #fdcb6e)
- **Success**: Teal tones (#00b894, #00cec9)
- **Background**: Dark gradient (black to deep blue)

## üì± Mobile Experience

The application is fully responsive and touch-enabled:
- Touch drawing support
- Responsive layout that stacks controls vertically on mobile
- Optimized canvas size for mobile screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Patterns
To add a new drawing pattern, extend the `ShapeDrawer` class:

```javascript
drawNewPattern(x, y, size) {
    // Your pattern drawing logic here
    this.ctx.beginPath();
    // ... drawing commands ...
    this.ctx.fill();
}
```

### Adding New Center Shapes
Extend the `drawCenterShape()` method in `CanvasManager`:

```javascript
case 'newShape':
    this.drawNewCenterShape(this.centerX, this.centerY, size);
    break;
```
